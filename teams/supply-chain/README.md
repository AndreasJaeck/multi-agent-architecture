# Supply Chain Team - Advanced Genie API Features & Security

## Hackathon Goals

**Core Objectives:**
- Evaluate and demonstrate advanced Genie API capabilities for complex supply chain analytics
- Test enterprise-grade security features including Row-Level Security (RLS) and Column-Level Masking (CM)
- Build robust multi-agent systems for supply chain optimization and risk management

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Genie Spaces Configuration**: Set up 2 comprehensive Genie spaces for testing advanced supply chain scenarios (inventory optimization, demand forecasting, supplier performance)
- **Vector Index Strategy**: Implement additional vector indexes for semantic search across supply chain documents, contracts, and operational data
- **Security Evaluation**: Thorough testing of On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication patterns with RLS/CM integration
- **Join Features Analysis**: Evaluate Genie local join capabilities for predefined relationship mapping across supply chain entities

**Key Deliverables:**
- Secure multi-tenant supply chain analytics platform with proper access controls
- Advanced data joining patterns for complex supply chain relationships
- Automated risk assessment and supplier performance monitoring system
- Best practices for implementing RLS/CM in enterprise Genie deployments
- Performance benchmarks for vector search in supply chain optimization scenarios
