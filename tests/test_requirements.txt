# Test dependencies
# Install with: pip install -e .[test]
# 
# This file is maintained for backward compatibility
# All dependencies are now managed in pyproject.toml
#
# To install test dependencies:
# - Modern approach: pip install -e .[test] 
# - Legacy approach: pip install -r test_requirements.txt

# Legacy format for tools that still expect requirements.txt
# These should match the [project.optional-dependencies.test] section in pyproject.toml
