# Multi-Agent Architecture

A comprehensive framework for building scalable multi-agent systems with multiple architectural patterns and production-ready implementations.

## Overview

This project provides implementations of various multi-agent architecture patterns, focusing on hierarchical supervisor systems with MLflow integration for enterprise deployment. The architecture supports different coordination patterns including tool-calling, streaming responses, and circuit breaker resilience.

## Multi-Agent Patterns & Flow Charts

### 1. Hierarchical Architecture

**Description**: Tree-like structure with parent-child relationships where higher-level agents manage and coordinate lower-level specialists.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Top-Level Supervisor]
    B --> C{Task Analysis}
    C --> D[Domain Supervisor 1]
    C --> E[Domain Supervisor 2]
    C --> F[Domain Supervisor 3]

    D --> D1[Specialist Agent 1A]
    D --> D2[Specialist Agent 1B]

    E --> E1[Specialist Agent 2A]
    E --> E2[Specialist Agent 2B]

    F --> F1[Specialist Agent 3A]

    D1 --> G[Response Aggregation]
    D2 --> G
    E1 --> G
    E2 --> G
    F1 --> G
    G --> H[Final Response]
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Clear chain of command and responsibility
- Natural delegation of complex tasks
- Fault isolation by hierarchy level
- Scales vertically (adding layers)

### 2. Pipeline/Sequential Architecture

**Description**: Fixed chain of agents where each agent processes and passes results to the next agent in sequence.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Input Processor]
    B --> C[Data Validator]
    C --> D[Business Logic Agent]
    D --> E[Results Formatter]
    E --> F[Output Generator]
    F --> G[Final Response]

    subgraph "Stage 1: Input"
        B
    end

    subgraph "Stage 2: Processing"
        C
        D
    end

    subgraph "Stage 3: Output"
        E
        F
    end
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Predictable, linear flow
- Easy to optimize individual stages
- Clear data lineage
- Handles staged processing well

### 3. Flexible Supervisor (Task-Oriented)

**Description**: Intelligent supervisor that can handle tasks directly, use tools, or route to specialists based on task requirements.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Flexible Supervisor]
    B --> C{Task Assessment}

    C --> D{Can handle directly?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Direct Response]
    D -->|No| F{Requires tools?}

    F -->|Yes| G[Tool Selection]
    F -->|No| H[Specialist Routing]

    G --> I[Tool Execution]
    H --> J[Specialist Agent]

    I --> K[Response Integration]
    J --> K
    E --> L[Final Response]
    K --> L
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dynamic routing based on actual needs
- Supervisor maintains direct capabilities
- Planning-driven approach
- Optimizes execution path per request

### 4. Swarm Architecture

**Description**: Many simple, autonomous agents that interact locally to achieve global objectives through emergent behavior.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Global Objective] --> B[Agent Swarm]
    B --> C[Agent 1]
    B --> D[Agent 2]
    B --> E[Agent 3]

    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I{Emergent Behavior}
    I --> J[Collective Solution]

    K --> L
```

**Key Characteristics:**

    L --> C
```

**Key Characteristics:**

## Implementation Examples

### FMAPI Supervisor Agent

A hybrid multi-agent architecture combining **hierarchical coordination**, **federated autonomy**, and **progressive disclosure** patterns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[RegistryToolCallingAgent<br/>Central Coordinator]

    B --> C[Planning Phase<br/>Communicates Intent]
    C --> D[Progressive Disclosure<br/>Execution Planning]

    D --> E{Dynamic Assessment}
    E --> F[Direct Response<br/>Simple Tasks]
    E --> G[Delegation to Domain Experts<br/>Complex Tasks]

    G --> H[Domain Expert 1<br/>Supervisor + Synthesis]
    G --> I[Domain Expert 2<br/>Supervisor + Synthesis]
    G --> J[Domain Expert N<br/>Supervisor + Synthesis]

    H --> H1[Sub-Agent A]
    H --> H2[Sub-Agent B]
    I --> I1[Sub-Agent C]
    I --> I2[Sub-Agent D]
    J --> J1[Sub-Agent E]

    H1 --> HS[Domain Synthesis]
    H2 --> HS
    I1 --> IS[Domain Synthesis]
    I2 --> IS
    J1 --> JS[Domain Synthesis]

    HS --> K[Expert Response<br/>Federated Autonomy]
    IS --> K
    JS --> K

    K --> L[Supervisor Response Integration]
    F --> L
    L --> M[Streaming Updates<br/>Progressive Disclosure]
    M --> N[Final Response]

    M --> E
```

**Hybrid Architecture Characteristics:**
- **Hierarchical**: Multi-level coordination where central supervisor delegates to domain expert supervisors
- **Federated**: Each domain expert maintains autonomous planning and orchestrates sub-agents
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Communicates intentions and dynamically plans execution steps
- **Distributed Synthesis**: Domain experts perform their own synthesis before forwarding to supervisor
- **Real-time Feedback Loop**: Streaming updates can trigger re-assessment during response generation

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent task routing with LLM-driven analysis and intent communication
- Hierarchical domain experts that orchestrate specialized sub-agents
- Distributed synthesis and response integration across multiple levels
- Real-time feedback loops from streaming updates to dynamic assessment for continuous improvement
- Progressive disclosure with streaming updates and reasoning
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery across federated agent hierarchies
- Production observability with MLflow tracing and streaming events

## Hybrid Patterns

Most production systems combine multiple architectural patterns to achieve optimal results. The FMAPI Supervisor Agent exemplifies this approach by integrating:

- **Multi-level hierarchical coordination** where domain experts themselves orchestrate sub-agents
- **Federated autonomy** with distributed synthesis and independent execution planning
- **Progressive disclosure** for transparent multi-level execution planning
- **Real-time feedback loops** enabling continuous assessment during streaming response generation

This hybrid design creates a sophisticated hierarchy where domain experts act as mini-supervisors, performing their own synthesis before forwarding results to the central coordinator, with real-time feedback loops from streaming updates enabling continuous improvement through dynamic re-assessment.
